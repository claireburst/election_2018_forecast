# election_2018_forecast

Here is my forecast:  
- Democrats easily take the House
- Although it will be close, Republicans will keep the Senate :/ 

Voter registration is dramatically elevated and civic engagement -- specifically among millenials and gen X -- is high. Therefore, I think the blue wave will be prominent. 

No matter what Preceptor says, I think the Blue Wave is real!!! #BETOFORTEXAS!!! Also, never trust FiveThirtyEight. We learned that lesson in 2018. Those are my thoughts. 

Sincerely,
Dr. Claire Fridkin
